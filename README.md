# DrawerOrganizer
This Drawer Organizer is interlockable and stackable, and helps you arrange small items in drawers in a neat manner.

## Naming Rule
* Lxx: Length xx cm
* Wyy: Width yy cm
* Hzz: Height zz cm
* TopCut1.5: Cut 1.5 mm downwards at internal and top faces for stacking other boxes.
* BotFlat: The box at the bottom layer with interlock slots.
* BotExt1.4: The box above the bottom layer with an extrusive part of 1.4 mm for stacking on top of lower boxes.
* plug-offset0.28: The interlock plug with a tolerance of 0.28mm, which is good for my printing. You may change it in the design file.

I keep the design history and use parameters in the f3d file (Fusion360), and you may freely edit the design in f3d or step files. Commercial use is NOT allowed.
